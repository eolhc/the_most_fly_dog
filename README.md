## Who is The Most Fly Dog?

The Most Fly Dog is a flying dog named Dogg, who wishes to buy a burger. Buying a burger requires human money. Your goal is to guide Dogg over Wall Street is his quest to collect money without getting stabbed and robbed! Get $10, get a BURGER!

## Why 

We were given free reign to create anything for our final project at General Assembly. I want to create lots of things but, eventually, settled on my most recent interest, three.js. 

## What I Learned

Using three.js was a continual learning process. In particular, I had to think not only about how to create scenes and objects with three.js but about how each my meshes and scenes interacted with the game mechanisms and how to build things in three.js There was a lot of refactoring simply because I was always learning how to use three.js.

## Where This Could Go

I wish to add a 3D burger, more obstacles, more surprises and faster speeds and goals with additional gameplay levels.
